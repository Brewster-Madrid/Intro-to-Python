# 🐍 Introduction to Python

Welcome to **Introduction to Python**, a beginner-friendly course designed to help **high school students** and **teachers new to Python or computer science** gain a solid foundation in Python programming through **project-based learning**.

---

## 🚀 Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive introduction to Python programming through six core skill modules and four hands-on projects. Each skill module includes PowerPoint presentations adapted from Python for Everybody (py4e.com) by Charles Severance, and each project provides progressive exercises with automated tests or solution files to validate your learning. The course is structured to build competency from basic syntax through advanced programming concepts like data structures, user authentication, and CRUD operations.

## 📦 How to Use This Course

### Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already
3. Install pytest for running automated tests: `pip install pytest`

### Learning Path
1. Start with the PowerPoint presentations in order (Variables → Conditionals → Functions → Loops → Strings → Lists)
2. Work through each project in sequence, completing all versions before moving to the next project
3. Each project folder contains:
   - 📘 A detailed README with instructions and learning goals
   - ✅ Progressive exercises building from basic to advanced
   - 🧪 Test files (Projects 1-3) or solution files (Project 4) to validate your work
   - 🧠 Code reflection requirements to deepen understanding

### Testing Your Code
- For Projects 1-3: Run `pytest <test_file_name>` to validate your solutions
- For Project 4: Compare your output with the provided solution files
- All code should be wrapped in `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks for testability

### Tips for Success
- Complete projects in order as they build on previous concepts
- Include code reflections at the bottom of each file explaining your approach
- Test your code frequently and iteratively
- Don't skip exercises—each builds essential skills
